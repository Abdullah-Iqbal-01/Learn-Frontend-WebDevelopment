## HTML5: A Foundation for Modern Web Development

**HTML5** is the latest version of the HyperText Markup Language, the standard language for creating web pages and applications. It offers significant improvements over previous versions, making it easier to create more engaging, interactive, and accessible web content.

### Key Features of HTML5

* **Semantic Elements:** Provide clear meaning to the structure of a webpage, improving SEO and accessibility. Examples include `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`.
* **Multimedia Support:** Embed audio and video directly into web pages using `<audio>` and `<video>` elements, reducing reliance on plugins.
* **Offline and Application Cache:** Allow web applications to function offline or with limited connectivity by storing data locally.
* **Canvas:** Provides a dynamic, programmable canvas for drawing graphics and animations directly in the browser.
* **Geolocation:** Accesses the user's geographic location with their permission.
* **Form Improvements:** Enhanced form elements and input types (like email, date, number) for better user experience.
* **Web Storage:** Stores data locally in the user's browser (localStorage, sessionStorage) for persistent data handling.
